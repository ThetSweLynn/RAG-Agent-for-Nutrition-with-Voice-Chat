        "bot": "Adequate protein intake is essential for muscle building as it provides the amino acids needed for muscle\nprotein synthesis.  Combined with resistance training, a higher protein intake can promote muscle growth and\nimprove body composition.  However, excessive protein intake won't automatically lead to more muscle mass\nwithout proper training.  Individual protein needs vary based on factors like training intensity, experience,\nand total calorie intake.\n\n**Potential Benefits:**\n\n* Increased muscle protein synthesis\n* Improved muscle recovery after exercise\n* Enhanced muscle growth and strength gains\n* Preservation of lean body mass during weight loss\n\n**Potential Risks (primarily with excessively high protein intakes):**\n\n* Strain on kidney function (especially for those with pre-existing kidney conditions)\n* Dehydration\n* Potential nutrient deficiencies if other food groups are neglected to prioritize protein\n* Digestive issues (e.g., bloating, constipation) in some individuals\n\nIt's important to consult a registered dietitian or sports nutritionist to determine the right protein intake\nfor individual needs and goals.  The provided texts don't offer specific protein recommendations for muscle\nbuilding but emphasize protein's importance as a \"body-building\" nutrient.  They also caution against solely\nrelying on protein for muscle growth without adequate exercise.\n\n\nSources:\n1. Nutrition Data\\fundamentals-of-foodnutrition-and-diet-therapy.pdf\n2.
